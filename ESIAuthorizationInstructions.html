    EVE Isk per Hour - Application Registration Instructions </h1>

    <p>To use EVE IPH to its fullest potential, you must authorize the application to view your characters' details through CCP's Single Sign On (SSO) Authentication system, called EVE Swagger Interface (ESI). Through the Autheticated API access option, this sytem allows IPH to access your selected permission scopes to read things like your character's assets, skills, and blueprints. This process also ensures that you have control of access to your character and you can remove that access at any time. Additionally, to keep your information secure as possible, any information about this application is available to you only. </p> 
<p>The following steps will allow you to register EVE IPH as an application and allow you to utilize API access within the program.</p>
<p>First, you are probably here because you clicked the "Instructions" button on the ESI Authorization window in EVE IPH. That window is where you will store data from each of the steps below.</p>
